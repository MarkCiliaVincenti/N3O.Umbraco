## Generating Clients

This folder contains a cross-platform [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) script for regenerating the API clients. In order to run the script you will need to ensure you have the `n3o-tool` [dotnet tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools) installed. You can install this by running `dotnet tool install -g n3o-tool`.
